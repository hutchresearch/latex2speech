Exceptional Commands that Should be Handled

\par, \paragraph, \\
    - Should enclose everything from use of \par (or eqiv) to next use of \par (or equiv) 
    or if none exist then to the end of the relevant section (?) in the SSML <p>...</p> tag
\enumerate (and similar things)
    - Implicitly adds text (numbers) which should be read aloud-
    - What this text is can be modified by other commands (!!!)


Inference of Text Generated by LaTeX:
    + Many occurences of this
        - enumerate, section, ref (numbers generated, based on number of previous occurences)
        - figure -> caption, newtheorem -> theorem (prepends text)
    + Relying on ourselves to record all these in our pronunciation file manually would be time consuming and error prone, BUT...
        - Text cannot be reliably extracted from PDF's https://filingdb.com/b/pdf-text-extraction
        - TeX distributions are typesetting programs, designed to go from the TeX input to an output file format. There is no "intermediate output"
        - Therefore, we're pretty much stuck with the bill.
